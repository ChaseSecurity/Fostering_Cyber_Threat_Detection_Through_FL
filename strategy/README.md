**Note: Move all the files into your python site packages folder, e.g. `venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/flwr/server/strategy/`.**

These aggregation strategy scripts in this folder are customized for each aggregation rule in our paper, including Multi-Krum, Trimmed Mean, LIE, MIN-MAX, MIN-SUM, etc.

If want to try your own customized aggregating rule, you can find more guidance in the strategy description in [Flower tutorial](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/tutorial-series-build-a-strategy-from-scratch-pytorch.html).
