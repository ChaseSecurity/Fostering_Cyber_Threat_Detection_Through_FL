# 2. Preprocess your data.

## Central learning


A small dataset is prepared to facilitate quickstart, which includes train datasets [../data/benign/](../data/benign/), [../data/malware](../data/malware), and test datasets [../data/test_dataset/](../data/test_dataset/).

## Federated learning

**Can not skip this even to simply try.**

Large amount of apk files are used in federated learning, so you **need to preprocess the data in your local device**.

### Steps

1. [Decompile](decompile).

> Note: A small dataset without preprocessing is also already prepared to get started more easily.

2. Configure and try [splitClientsData.ipynb](splitClientsData.ipynb).
